## Etch-a-Sketch App

This Etch-a-Sketch App is a dynamic sketch pad that gives users the liberty 
to customize the canvas, define the pen activation mode, and specify any ink 
color to use for sketching.

Furthermore, users can choose either to erase specific part of their sketch 
or to clear the whole canvas.

Feel free to [use the app here](https://oluwatobi-s.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
